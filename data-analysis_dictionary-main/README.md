Data analysis with python dictionary
The python dictionary is an extremely powerful tool. I can't exactly say that 
this program is for beginners, but once you master the dictionary, you can see how to manipulate 
data with a single dictionary. This program was written to show the power of the dictionary. 
It is only available in the text version of the same program. To run, you need to download the icon and other file.
